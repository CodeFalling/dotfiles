${1:Hi} ${2:Project Leader},

Do you think it would be appropriate for ${3:your project} to be associated with the CSCT and listed on our project page, please?

http://www.bath.ac.uk/csct/research/projects

If you've already got a website, I can simply link to that. If not, I can put together a short page based on the information from the research council web pages, like this example:

http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K026380/1

http://www.bath.ac.uk/csct/research/projects/20130318-clever.html

Please could you give me a yes or no ASAP.

Many thanks,
Jez
